5/22/25:
- Log:
	- All:
		- Research sound library 
		- Figure out how the beat detector works
		- How can we create a random arrow pattern using beat detector
		- Call on zoom this weekend to start assigning tasks to everyone
- Functionalities:
	- Expect to understand sound library by tomorrow
	- Expect to further plan out methods tomorrow
- Completed:
	- Sound Library Research done


5/23/25
- Log:
	- Amy:
		- Fix Cardinality for UML diagram
	- All:
		- Continue research on each of the listed methods in the Helpful Methods doc
- Functionalities:
	- Expect to understand all the different helpful methods
	- Start planning out methods tomorrow
- Completed:

5/27/25
	- Eve: 
		- Experimented with beat detection, ultimately using FFT as it was the best beat detector out of all the Sound Library analyzing methods
		- Created basic sample code for when arrows should fall down
		- Expected to complete basic arrow code soon
	- Amy:
		- Completed a rough draft of the MainMenu class, implementing all instance variables and methods
		- Update Design Document for Progress Meeting 1 tomorrow
	- Esther:
		- Completed a rough draft of Arrow class, implementing all instance variables and methods

5/28/25
	- All: 
		- Worked on sound detecting mechanism with FFT
		- Arrows now fall on beat

5/30/25 to 6/1/25
	- All: fixed inheritance issues and bugs preventing sketch from running

6/2/25
	- Esther: 
		- Making arrows the right size 
		- Worked on making arrows fall in the right column
		- Edited bottom arrow bar so that when an arrow is pressed the image changes color
	Eve: 
		- Implemented off set timer so that the player can hit the arrow on the beat 
		- Chose stage background
		- Deleted arrows after they go past the bottom bar
	Amy:
		- Updated UML diagram
		- Created the Screen abstract class
		- Fixed MainMenu class so it runs
