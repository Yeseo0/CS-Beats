		- Call on zoom this weekend to start assigning tasks to everyone
- Functionalities:
	- Expect to understand sound library by tomorrow
	- Expect to further plan out methods tomorrow
- Completed:
	- Sound Library Research done


5/23/25
- Log:
	- Amy:
		- Fix Cardinality for UML diagram
	- All:
		- Continue research on each of the listed methods in the Helpful Methods doc
- Functionalities:
	- Expect to understand all the different helpful methods
	- Start planning out methods tomorrow
- Completed:

5/27/25
	- Eve: 
		- Experimented with beat detection, ultimately using FFT as it was the best beat detector out of all the Sound Library analyzing methods
		- Created basic sample code for when arrows should fall down
		- Expected to complete basic arrow code soon
	- Amy:
		- Completed a rough draft of the MainMenu class, implementing all instance variables and methods
		- Update Design Document for Progress Meeting 1 tomorrow
	- Esther:
		- Completed a rough draft of Arrow class, implementing all instance variables and methods

5/28/25
	- All: 
		- Worked on sound detecting mechanism with FFT
		- Arrows now fall on beat

5/30/25 to 6/1/25
	- All: fixed inheritance issues and bugs preventing sketch from running

6/2/25
	- Esther: 
		- Making arrows the right size 
		- Worked on making arrows fall in the right column
		- Edited bottom arrow bar so that when an arrow is pressed the image changes color
	Eve: 
		- Implemented off set timer so that the player can hit the arrow on the beat 
		- Chose stage background
		- Deleted arrows after they go past the bottom bar
	Amy:
		- Updated UML diagram
		- Created the Screen abstract class
		- Fixed MainMenu class so it runs 

6/3/25
	- All: worked on fixing Target Invocation Error

6/3/25-6/4/25
    - All: worked on fixing Target Invocation Error since it prevented us from progressing

6/5/25
	- Eve: Fixed Target Invocation Error!!! YAY :)
			- Next Step: fixing mouse pressed and key pressed for main menu (doesnâ€™t go to play), and having a less specific region that works when clicked for home page
	- Esther: Fixed arrow class time delay bug but found issues with keyPressed() method (which eliminates pressed arrows) not being in the class containing the draw() method

6/6/25-6/8/25
	- Amy:
		- Adjust dimensions of the images
		- Add details to the HomePage background
		- Fix mousePressed() to be the right coords and & keyPressed() of each class
	- Eve:
		- Fix Play class delay timer
		- Implement basic score/accuracy mechanism
		- Implement rough draft of stars 
        - Test BAAB
	- Esther:
		- Add combos to Play class

6/9/25
	- Amy:
		- Fix preview song swapping/playing the audio
		- Fix UML diagram
	- Eve
		- Fix volume increase/decrease

6/10/25
	- Amy
	- Eve
		- Fix preview song playing when going back to home page 
		- Fix left arrow background switch
		- Implement cooldown and fall times for beauty and a beat
		- Add to accuracy function 
	- Esther
		- Fix unintentional audio reverb and lag 
		- Fix preview song playing during play 
		- Fix arrow bar location
		- Add progress bar
		- Add quit button to exit while playing song (exit bar)
